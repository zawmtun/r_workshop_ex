## Pivoting

## Long and wide data format

**Example 1**

![Wide data: Time series TB notification of cities](images/Screenshot%202023-04-07%20at%207.11.45%20AM.png){width="338"}

![Long data: Time series TB notification of cities](images/Screenshot%202023-04-07%20at%207.12.42%20AM.png){width="239"}

**Example 2**

![Wide data: Hospital clinic types](images/Screenshot%202023-04-07%20at%207.20.54%20AM.png){width="322"}

![Long data: Hospital clinic types](images/Screenshot%202023-04-07%20at%207.21.04%20AM.png){width="293"}

**Practice exercise**

```{r}
population <- data.frame(
  country = c("Pakistan", "Bangladesh", "Singapore"),
  pop_2020 = 1:3,
  pop_2021 = 4:6,
  pop_2022 = 7:9
)

population
```

**When should we use long VS wide data?**

It depends on what you want to accomplish.

-   Wide format is best for displaying data.

-   Long format is best for some data analysis tasks like grouping and summarising.

The process of converting between long and wide data formats is called pivoting.
